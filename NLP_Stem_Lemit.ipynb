        "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, reason, learn, and make decisions. In technical terms, AI is a branch of computer science that focuses on designing systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human cognitive abilities such as perception, speech recognition, problem-solving, and decision-making.\n",
